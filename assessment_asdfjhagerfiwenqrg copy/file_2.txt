You have to ensure you do justice to each part.
Inorganizing the content of a poster, headings, numbering,
bullets, graphics and blank spaces should all be appropriately deployed for maximum impact.
This can be a real game changer.
Since the poster is mostly visual, words should only be used when necessary.
Having too many words or words in unnecessary
places in your poster can be a disaster.
Wordy posters can be boring.
So, they should be avoided by all means.
In addition,
font style and size should be carefully chosen for the desired impact.
Color combination is another crucial factor in a
poster.
This is particularly important because the kinds of colors used can determine whether the poster will be good enough
to attract attention after printing.
