" Welcome to the second lesson of the course, Doing Presentations Like A Pro.
This course is designed to help you elevate
your presentation game.
In the first lesson, we learnt about the rudiments of academic presentations.
We saw that these
presentations are important to promote knowledge, creation, as they facilitate cross-fortalization of ideas.
We also
identified poster and oral presentations as the two main types of presentation.
In the second lesson, we shall focus on
poster presentations.
We will consider the format, content, organization, words, fonts, colors, and printing required
for a good poster.
To start with, a poster is a visual representation of an idea or research finding to be disseminated to
an audience.
One of the most common standard sizes of poster is the A zero paper size with dimension 841 by 1189 mm.
Or, 33.1
by 46.8 inches.
