" Hello, welcome to the Cospitude doing presentations like the Pro, where we are going to consider 10 interesting lessons.
I am very sure that anything you want to do, you want to be seen as the expert, you want to be seen as the professional who is actually
good at what he does.
And when it comes to the idea of presentations, you want to actually show that you know exactly what you
are doing.
In the first lesson, we will consider the rudiments of academic presentation, which will answer the questions
of words, why, where, who and how, as far as academic presentations are concerned, we will get to investigate the basics,
the fundamentals, the things that really form the crux of academic presentations.
Get into it, what is academic presentation?
Academic presentation involves a speaker sharing academic knowledge or discoveries with an audience.
Such a presentation
can be about the findings of a research, which expand the body of knowledge in a given subject matter.
Academic presentations
can be informed of posters and they could be delivered orally without a deck of slides.
So when you give academic presentations,
you are actually presenting new ideas or you are presenting all the ideas in a new way or you are trying to expound an idea that
has always been and that can be done through graphic methods like posters or you can actually talk about those things using
slides.
Do why academic presentations are necessary?
It is important to note that it helps to promote education by encouraging
the cross-fotalization of ideas.
The beauty of a speaker making a presentation is basically to arouse the curiosity of
the audience such that intelligent questions are asked and answered.
