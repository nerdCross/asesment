" Of course, by the very essence of their job description, we have to present new kinds of information to their students.
And
that is teaching on its own can be said to be a form of academic presentation.
And the principles of academic presentation
should actually be useful in that process.
Researchers are also people that are important in giving academic presentations.
As they go about investigating things as they try to see the causes and effects of setting phenomena, by the time they arrive
at whatever findings they arrive at, they should be able to disseminate the information because it is important to note
that any research that has been made, they have no bearing on society is actually an exercise in futility.
So researchers
having discovered things in the course of their duties should actually make academic presentations to share the ideas
to sell the ideas for the promotion of knowledge.
Policy makers are also important stakeholders in the knowledge creation
process who should make presentations in most places.
One research has conducted their research and have got different
kinds of findings.
They are usually expected to come up with policies statements which are presented to say lawmakers that
can actually make legislations around these things.
Such people who get to their point of making policies should actually
make their presentations because in making laws for instance, presentations are made and people get to debate all of this
points before legislations are formed that are accepted for implementation in society.
Finally, we look at how academic
presentations should be and with that say, I think academic presentations should be clear, they should be concise and captivating.
In other words, academic presentations should be easy to understand.
