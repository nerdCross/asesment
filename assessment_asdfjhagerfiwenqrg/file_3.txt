" That is the element of clarity.
Why you make a presentation?
Nobody should be in doubt as to what you are saying.
The idea should be clear enough to everyone.
Academic presentations
also should contain every necessary information in as few words as possible.
This talks about conciseness.
We do not use
words unnecessarily, anywhere that is not important in your presentation is better removed.
You have enough words to describe
what you are talking about in such a way that the idea you are selling is actually comprehensive.
Academic presentations
should also arouse the interest of listeners.
So a successful presentation is one that makes people who are listening to
you to actually want to investigate further what you have told them in summary.

To learn all this information, I am sure you will give smashing presentations going forward.
When next year on opportunity, you definitely want to put up your A game so that your presentations can be clear, concise
