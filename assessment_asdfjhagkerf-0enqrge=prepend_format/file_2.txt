" In doing a poster presentation, the presenter would usually take about 5 minutes to speak to the poster and
then stand by for questions.
The number of questions a poster presentation generates can be a deciding factor for its success.
That is to say, you will know how successful your poster presentation is if it generates a lot of questions afterwards.
This
would be an indication that your poster is interesting to people and that people are interested in the thoughts you are trying
to share in that poster.
The choice of poster formats is usually left for the presenter.
