" We will consider the format, content, organization, words, fonts, colors, and printing required
for a good poster.
To start with, a poster is a visual representation of an idea or research finding to be disseminated to
an audience.
One of the most common standard sizes of poster is the A zero paper size with dimension 841 by 1189 mm.
Or, 33.1

In doing a poster presentation, the presenter would usually take about 5 minutes to speak to the poster and
then stand by for questions.
The number of questions a poster presentation generates can be a deciding factor for its success.
