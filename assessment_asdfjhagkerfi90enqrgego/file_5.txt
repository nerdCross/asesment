" Marova, good quality printing is important.
If you think of how your poster will appear,
after printing, right from the moment you set out to design the poster.
So, this is all about keeping the end in view.
You do
not want to choose formats or design templates or color combinations that will not be good after you print as a recap.
The
poster presentation has a lot to do with a poster and as such, can you be taking to make good decisions about key features that
I stated before, like format, content, organization and the printing.
A masterful interplay of all these components will
set your poster presentation apart.
